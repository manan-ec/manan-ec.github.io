Nov 15 - Nov 21<br>
Week#: 47/52<br><br>

### Wednesday, Nov 20:

- Multiselect: For breaking it down more, coding basic implementation of the approach
- Separating the selection from fabric seems tricky, disabled `PickAndMove` and added `FabricObject.prototype.selectable = false`, still I am able to select and move the objects
