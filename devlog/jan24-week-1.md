Jan 1 - Jan 7<br>

Started with an Onboarding Call with Ab and Viswanadh P. Got an idea of how my learning journey will be during these 6 months and what timeline I'll be following,i.e just a rough idea of how I'll be getting job ready after these 6 months.

### Tuesday, Jan 2:

- Trying to figure out why the sql data was not being persistent, googling and checking the bind mounts of the db container, I got to know that the needs to ba a data/mysql folder for the container to write, made it and it worked.
- After adding a wordrobe, I was getting Uncaught in promise error from the loader getting the furnishes.
- Turns out that the json it was requesting was not stored properly on the cdn, which lead to the error.
- Had a meet with ab, discussed about recording the sesions of the users to figure out what issues are they having while using, so that the product can be made more intuitive.
- There were 2 good options to choose from: smartlook, and highlight.io, went with smartlook as it was simpler and was sufficient for now.
