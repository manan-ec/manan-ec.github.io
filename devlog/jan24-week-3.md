Jan 15 - Jan 21<br>

### Monday, Jan 15:

- Solved a bug where shift selecting room when a furnishing is on it, turned floor to be opaque and hid the walls.
- Implemented `FurnishingConstrainer` which moves furnishings along with floor when shift moving it.
- Still implementing `FurnishingConstrainer`.
- Implemented it and checked all edge cases, made the PR.
- Had a meet with Ab, discussed what should happen on edge cases and how should we merge the mess of `lock-rooms`,`FurnishingConstrainer` and `layoutplannerjs-refactor`.
- Made the changes and made the final PR for `FurnishingConstrainer`.
- Had a meet with Ab for the code review for both `lock-rooms` and `FurnishingConstrainer`.
- Pulled the updated master branch, rebased refactor branch on top of the updated changes.
