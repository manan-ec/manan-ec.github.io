Jan 1 - Jan 7<br>

### Monday, Jan 9:

- Started by trying to lock the room as Ab has figured out the flow of component moving over the weekend, turns out that without fully understanding the library, it get more and more complex.
- So kept this issue on hold and started to make a block diagram of how the library is working and how and which events are fired from where and listended fro where.
