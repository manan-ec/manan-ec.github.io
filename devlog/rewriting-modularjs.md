## Rewriting modular.js
<br>

#### October 31:

I'm trying to get the component move to work. A few considerations:

- Component move should show a shadow moving with the pointer.
- Undo should set the state to before the move was initiated.
- Move should snap to all the relavent snap points.

It has been a week since, I last looked at the code. So, there's has been a context reset. I don't think I can get up to speed and make changes in just 2 hours. I'll work on something else today and start off tomorrow.
